title: Describe what you like and dislike about the CSS preprocessors you have used.
---

## Likes

- Mostly the advantages mentioned in ["What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?"](/questions/quiz/what-are-the-advantages-disadvantages-of-using-css-preprocessors).
- Less is written in JavaScript, which plays well with Node.

## Dislikes

- Sass relies on `node-sass`, which is a binding for LibSass written in C++. The library has to be recompiled frequently when switching between Node.js versions.
- In Less, variable names are prefixed with `@`, which can be confused with native CSS keywords like `@media`, `@import` and `@font-face` rule.
